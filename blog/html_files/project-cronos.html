    Project Cronos is a passion project of ours that we have been slowly working on the past two months. We are excited
    to share its initial release. If you want to learn more about the development and technical underpinnings check out
    our <a href="/blog/building-project-cronos">technical deep-dive</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Project Cronos is a project management tool that we are using internally to manage our work. Up until now, our
    project management, budgeting, time tracking, and invoicing has been done across multiple Google Sheets, Google
    Docs, and scratchpads of paper. With Cronos we are able to accurately manage our billable time across multiple
    projects and reduce the time we need to generate professional invoices.
</p>
<p>
    There are a lot of SaaS products in this market that we could have used, but we wanted to build something that
    would be tailored to our specific needs and would act as a portfolio piece for our team. The costs of
    maintaining this product are minuscule, a fraction of what we would have paid for a similar SaaS product (if
    you ignore the upfront development costs).
</p>
<p>
    Below screenshots show some of the workflow steps for a user. First upon logging in they will see a dashboard with
    a calendar view which will have time blocked off for any previously entered time entries.

<p>
    From the calendar view, user can click Add Entry to record time working on a project. This will prompt them to
    select a billing code, of which they will have a curated list assigned to them. They will then record the time
    that they spent working and a description of their work.

<p>
    The rest of the features are limited to administrators, such as adding new projects, clients, and billing.
    The most powerful feature is the ability to review drafted invoices and approve and send invoices. The screenshot
    below shows a fake draft invoice for work I recorded on the Cronos Project. The administrator can keep or void any
    of the line items before approving the invoice.

<p>
    Shareable Invoices are generated in PDF formats with both a billing code summary, and a detailed breakdown
    of the time and work recorded. These are delivered to the client via email and are also stored in the system for
    future reference.

<p>
    As we exit the beta phase
    of this project we'll be adding more features and onboarding our clients to the soon-to-be-released customer portal
    to review work, manage invoices, and view reports. If there is significant interest we'll be looking to either open
    source the project or license it as low-cost SaaS product to other small businesses.
