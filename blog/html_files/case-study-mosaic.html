<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Starting in early 2023, we began working with the team at Mosaic.tech to set up product analytics and reporting
    needs. A key goal was to clearly define and model their priority metrics.</p>
<p>Mosaic is a strategic finance platform for the entire business, providing a real-time analytics and planning
    platform that helps teams get from data to decision. This includes data consolidation, automated reporting,
    predictive modeling, insights, and alignment. With such vast product functionality, Mosaic values the ability to
    utilize their data to better understand their product, their customers, and drive towards more informed growth
    and customer success decisions.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Mosaic had implemented Heap for web tracking analytics, and had a plethora of production data tables, including
    internal audit log tracking. The main objective of the project was to develop high-value metrics to provide the
    client a baseline view of product performance.</p>
<p>Secondary objectives included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Secondary metric development</li>
    <li>Reviewing Heap implementation</li>
    <li>Modeling data into clean consumer data marts</li>
    <li>Building a metrics store to be accessible by Mosaic’s internal dashboarding tool</li>
    <li>Assisting in data integrations needed for using this product data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p><strong>Data Ingestion:</strong> Production data was ingested into Snowflake from s3 via snowpipe. Heap was
    directly integrated using Heap Connect’s Snowflake integration.</p>
<p><strong>Exploratory Analysis:</strong> There was a fair amount of exploratory work to understand the product,
    including schema relationships, grains, and the overall data model.</p>
<p><strong>Metric Development:</strong> Worked with primary stakeholders to understand product priorities and derive
    primary metrics. Prepared preliminary queries with various dimensions to sanity check and enable stakeholder QA.
</p>
<p><strong>Data Modeling:</strong> Designed and built the appropriate data models to result in a consumer data mart
    for product data. Implemented a metric layer for consistent metric definitions.</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>Mosaic had already set up their Snowflake instance with dbt cloud as their transformation tool. Their product has
    a dashboarding component and various data integrations, enabling them to avoid additional BI tooling. Beyond
    traditional visualization, Mosaic also used some external customer success tools where this data was going to be
    utilized.</p>

<h3>Snowpipe</h3>
<p>Snowpipe is a data ingestion service for Snowflake that enables automatic and continuous loading of streaming data
    into the Snowflake data warehouse. It simplifies the data loading process by enabling data streams from s3 to
    snowflake, triggered by updates to the specific s3 bucket.</p>

<h3>Snowflake + Snowsight</h3>
<p>Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehouse that provides scalability and flexibility, while Snowsight empowers
    users to easily analyze and derive insights from their data within the Snowflake platform.</p>

<h3>dbt (data build tool)</h3>
<p>dbt primary value-add is managing the business logic of metrics and modeling data for effective analysis. Column
    definitions can be managed in a documented and version-controlled fashion in dbt. It also helps establish a
    reporting layer with predefined metrics/structure for external systems to utilize.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Understanding the "source of truth" for event data was crucial, considering two
    event sources (Heap and Internal).</p>
<p><strong>Data Latency:</strong> Considering the data latency needs of the end users and leveraging the snowpipe
    system for simple weekly metrics.</p>
<p><strong>External Systems:</strong> Utilizing external systems required specific design patterns, and dbt enabled
    managing data modeling and permissions for external system needs.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Having the right tooling in place enabled us to work quickly and efficiently while consistently iterating for each
    step of this process. dbt has been instrumental in enabling us to keep the analytics data dependencies as
    simplified and untangled as possible. Snowflake with snowpipe enabled quick exploration as we defined metrics,
    and has the added benefit of managing permissions for various external system needs.</p>
