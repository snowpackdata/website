        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            We are a team of analytics professionals with experience spanning the data stack from backend data engineering through data modeling, and predictive analytics.
            Our mission is to provide high quality, bespoke work for our clients that accelerates their data maturity and empowers decision making.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Snowpack</h2>
        <p>
            The name Snowpack Data was derived from the process avalanche forecasters and backcountry skiers use to assess the stability of snow in the mountains. The members of our team
            are passionate about skiing and the science of snowpack stability has many parallels to the work we do in data analytics. We believe that the best data analytics work is done
            when the data is stable supported by well-defined layers across the analytical stack from ingestion to modeling and finally reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
            With our time-tested approach to analytics Snowpack offers an efficient option for companies looking to jumpstart their analytics organization or provide key
            support to their existing team. As consultants we are able to quickly deliver on key projects and provide a roadmap for future work that your team can execute on.
        </p>

    <section class="mission-section">
        <h2>Our Working Model</h2>
        <p>
            We work with our clients in two primary ways. The first is through project-based consulting. Our team will work with you to scope out a project with clear
            deliverables and timelines and execute on that project independently from your existing staff. This allows your organization to quickly deliver
            on key projects without the need to hire additional staff.

            The second is through an ongoing retainer. We select this option for clients who have flexible needs and want access to experts to either augment their
            existing staff or provide ongoing support for particularly large and complicated projects where their team may not have the right expertise.
        </p>
